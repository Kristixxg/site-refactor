## Corrections
1. Original Line 7 on the index.html: ```<title>Website</title>```  
 Correction:  ```<title>Horiseon Social Solution Services</title>```
-   Explaination: For instant, people who have multiple tabs open can easily identify which tab is which website. 
 

2. Original: ```<li>Search Engine Optimization</li>```   
 Correction: ``` <li><a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a></li> ```
 - Explaination: An anchor tag and a href were added so the listed item is linked with the same exact id. 

 3. Original: ```<img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left"/>```   
 Correction: ``` <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" alt="Notebook Image"/> ```
 - Explaination: alt="" attribute was added to all images which make the website more accessible. Above codeblock is one of the examples. 


## Installation

No other installation required. 


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.


## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)
