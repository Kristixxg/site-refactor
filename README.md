## Corrections
1. Original Line 7 on the index.html: ```<title>Website</title>```  
 Correction:  ```<title>Horiseon Social Solution Services</title>```
-   Explaination: One of good reasons to have a proper title for the website is that people who have multiple tabs open can easily identify which tab is which website. 
 

2. Original: ```<li>Search Engine Optimization</li>```   
 Correction: ``` <li><a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a></li> ```
 - Explaination: An anchor tag and a href were added so the listed item is linked with the same exact id. 

 3. Original: ```<img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left"/>```   
 Correction: ``` <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" alt="Notebook Image"/> ```
 - Explaination: alt="" attribute was added to all images which make the website more accessible. Above codeblock is one of the examples. 

 4. Original: ```.benefits {background-color: #2589bd;}```   
 Correction: ```.benefits {background-color: #0072bb;} ```
 - Explaination: Unless it's intentional, having consistent color scheme would make a website look more professional. 

 5. Correction: Added universal font-family onto the css style sheet.
 - Explaination: Unless it's intentional, having consistent font would make a website look more professional.
